# DISASTER RELIEF MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

#### Designed and developed a Java-based disaster relief management system to efficiently manage resource distribution, victim support, and data tracking in emergency response scenarios.

### Key features:
- Implemented using Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Singleton design patterns with a modular and extensible architecture.
- Integrated with a PostgreSQL database via JDBC to enable real-time storage and retrieval of victim and resource information.
- Created gender-inclusive data models and workflows to promote accessibility and inclusivity.
- Developed a menu-driven command-line interface (CLI) featuring input validation, data integrity checks, and detailed error logging.
- Built extensive JUnit 4 test suites following test-driven development (TDD) to ensure application reliability.
- Applied core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and interfaces.
- Provided multilingual support using XML configuration files, allowing runtime switching between English and French.
- Managed complex inventory rules, including location-based allocation, consumable tracking, and real-time database synchronization.

This project highlights strong OOP design, user-centered development, and seamless database integration, addressing real-world challenges in disaster management systems.
